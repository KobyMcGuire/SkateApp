# Skateboard Trainer
â€‹
This application is meant to be used as a tool for learning and expanding one's skill in skateboarding. The application is still under development, but some of the key features include
Trick Storage, Practice Sessions, and a Line Generator.

## Trick Storage

This page will allow the user to add tricks in to their existing bank of tricks. When walking through the create form, the user will input the name of the trick, the stance
in which the trick is done in, whether or not this trick is known to them, and also if the trick is composed of a flip, shuv, or a combination of the two. After submitting the
form, the trick will now appear in one of the two conatiners, depending upon whether the user knows the trick or not. If a trick is in "Your Bag", then this is a trick that
can be done by the user, otherwise, if a trick is in "In Progress Tricks", the user is still learning the trick. All trick cards on this page are drag-and-droppable.

## Practice Sessions

This page allows users to track and record their practice sessions, or sessions in general.

## Line Generator

A tool that can be used when you are at a park, or skating in the streets! A user tells the application how many tricks they would like in the line, and what kinds of tricks 
each one should be (Flat, Ledge, or Transition).
